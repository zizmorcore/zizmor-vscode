# Change Log

All notable changes to the "zizmor-vscode" extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.0.2

### Added

* The extension now checks `zizmor`'s version, and fails with a more
  useful error message if the installed version of `zizmor` is too old
  (or if `zizmor` is not installed at all)

## 0.0.1

This is the first official release of [zizmor](https://zizmor.sh) for VS Code!
